Answer: The context does not provide information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves drawing a precise boundary around the object of interest. The Sashimi toolkit uses the Mask R- CNN architecture, which is an extension of the Faster R- CNN algorithm, to perform instance segmentation. This allows the model to not only detect the presence or absence of a target in an image but also to isolate the specific pixels encapsulating that target. The model is trained using transfer learning against the 328,000 image COCO dataset.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?

Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the range of the input data to improve the performance of the model. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the input data.
