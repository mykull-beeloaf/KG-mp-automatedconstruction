Answer: The context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. %Context Context: Due to the unique characteristics of neural networks, which solve problems by exploiting the hidden relationships inherent in multiple input variables, it was difficult to physically quantify the importance of the input variables. As an alternative, we performed a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to explain which feature had the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in an operational retrieval system. For the SFIT, a single feature was randomly shuffled, while all the other features were kept constant. We iterated this process by changing the test variable. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance decreased with random shuffling. In this study, we used the root mean square error (RMSE) as the performance metric. 2. 5. Independent Validation of Species Richness Finally, we evaluated our two model results, S-SDMs and DL species richness, by comparing the species richness obtained from independent tree plot datasets from the Korea Forest Service [72].

We then calculated the overall correlation and local correlations between the species richness from the independent datasets and the results from the S-SDMs and DL species richness model.

Answer: The context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
