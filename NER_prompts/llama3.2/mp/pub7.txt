CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, while scaling adjusts the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The data was split into training and testing sets based on the year of the images.

In another experiment, the images from year 2011 were used for training and the images from 2012 and 2013 constitute the test set. In the third experiment, the training set consisted of two-thirds of the images from the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, whereas the test set consists of all the remaining images from the same years.
