CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization is the process of adjusting the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is the process of rescaling the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard range, such as 0 to 1 or -1 to 1. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the dataset. These preprocessing steps can help improve the performance and accuracy of the deep learning model.

This technique involves using a single observation from the original sample as the validation set and the remaining observations as the training set. This is repeated such that each observation in the sample is used once as the validation set. Additionally, it is mentioned that the validation parameter was increased to 20% due to the limited number of images per species.

The lowest identification rates were for closely- related species, and no systematic errors were detected in TensorFlow classification.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?

The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to evaluate model performance in Challenges 1, 3, and 4. Additionally, the validation parameter was increased to 20% due to the limited number of images per species (n = 20).
