The purpose of the deep learning model is to automate image segmentation, which involves detecting the pixel-level target region of interest and outputting a high-resolution segmentation contour reflecting the specific boundaries of the location of the target object within the image. %Explanation Explanation: The context mentions that the deep learning model is based on the Mask R-CNN architecture, which not only detects a target object in an image but also rapidly detects the pixel-level target region of interest, outputting a high-resolution segmentation contour reflecting the specific boundaries of the location of the target object within the image. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is to automate image segmentation.
