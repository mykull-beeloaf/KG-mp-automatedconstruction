The model was trained using TITAN Xp GPUs. Specifically, a minibatch size of four images per GPU was selected for training the model. The model was trained twice, once with a training subset of 498 images on a single GPU for 9000 iterations and then trained again on all 653 annotated images on three GPUs for 18000 iterations.
