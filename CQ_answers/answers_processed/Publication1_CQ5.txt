The paper does not explicitly mention the use of any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the deep learning pipeline uses large amounts of labeled data produced by analysts using the UI. This data is used to classify dozens of species signals and event types across ongoing projects. The paper also mentions the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward neural networks (DNNs) to audio spectrogram and image data. This suggests that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are likely audio and image data related to biodiversity monitoring.
