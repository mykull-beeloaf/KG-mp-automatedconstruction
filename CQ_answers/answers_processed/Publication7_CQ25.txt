The purpose of the deep learning model is for coral reef classification. The activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet are employed as feature representations in this work. The weights of this deep network are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The main contributions of this paper include a method to learn features using a CNN for coral reef classification and automatic annotation of unlabelled coral images and mosaics from the Abrolhos Islands in Western Australia.
