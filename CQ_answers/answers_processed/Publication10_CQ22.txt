The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the mean Dice coefficient loss function. The Dice coefficient is used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is given by: YXYX*2 Where, X is the predicted set of pixels and Y is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is the quotient of similarity and ranges between 0 and 1. It can be viewed as a similarity measure over sets. The loss function is just the minus of the Dice coefficient with the additions of a smoothing factor inserted in the denominator. The score in Table I is the mean of the Dice coefficients of images in the evaluation set.
