The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization is the process of adjusting the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is the process of rescaling the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard range, such as 0 to 1 or -1 to 1. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the dataset. These preprocessing steps can help improve the performance and accuracy of the deep learning model.
