The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that TensorFlow was trained on all images (i. e. , 400 spectrograms) from Challenge 1 as an image reference library. Additionally, it is mentioned that Inception v3 was trained on > 1 M images from the ImageNet database. Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are spectrograms and ImageNet.
