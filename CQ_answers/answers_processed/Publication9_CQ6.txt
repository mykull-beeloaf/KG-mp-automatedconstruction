The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the range of the input data to improve the performance of the model. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the input data.
