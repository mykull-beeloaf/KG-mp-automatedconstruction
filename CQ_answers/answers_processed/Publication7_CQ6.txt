The context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, while scaling adjusts the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data.
