The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the COCO evaluation metric, which determines whether the predicted organs and their locations are correct. The minimum threshold chosen for any prediction to be acceptable is having a confidence score (probability) of 0. 5. The COCO method calculates average precision (with values from 0 to 100), which is a metric that encapsulates both precision and recall of the detection, for the entire predictions and each class of organs at different levels of Intersection over Union (IoU). IoU is an evaluation metric that quantifies the overlap of the predicted bounding boxes with the ground-truth bounding boxes. The IoU score ranges from 0 to 1, the higher the overlap, the higher the IoU score. The evaluation method considers all predictions as positive that have IoU of at least 0. 5 and the average precision at this level of IoU is called AP50. Similarly, the average precision with a minimum IoU of 0. 75 is called AP75, whereas AP is the average over 10 IoU levels from 0. 5 to 0. 95 with a step size of 0. 05. The precision metrics evaluated on the predicted organs on the test subset are shown in Table 2. The COCO method also calculates the AP for each category, as shown in Table 3, along with the total bounding boxes for each category in the test subset.
