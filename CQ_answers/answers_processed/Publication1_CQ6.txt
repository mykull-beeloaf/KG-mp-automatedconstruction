The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation of the data. Normalization and scaling help to bring the data to a similar scale, cleaning helps to remove any noise or irrelevant data, and augmentation helps to increase the size of the dataset.
