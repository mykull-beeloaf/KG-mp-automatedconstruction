The purpose of the deep learning model is segmentation. It is used to segment bird vocalizations from audio spectrograms without requiring manual, laborious tagging of thousands of audio spectrograms. The model is a modified version of [6] and is trained on spectrogram figures of bird recordings as well as recordings void of any bird activity and their corresponding binary masks. During training, the spectrogram is presented as input, and the mask is presented as output, whereas the network learns the mapping in-between them. The network is forced to learn, by an iterative procedure, the mapping of vocalizations to binary blobs and to suppress everything else.
