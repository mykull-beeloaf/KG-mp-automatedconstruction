The deep learning model was implemented with the Detectron2 library in PyTorch framework and trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimiser with a learning rate of 0. 0025 and momentum of 0. 9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network had six anchor scales [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024] (square root of area in absolute pixels) each with three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1]. The thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) were 0. 6 for training and 0. 25 for testing, respectively.
