2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The deep learning pipeline uses audio and image data formats. The audio data is presented as spectrograms, while the image data is presented as image crops around the object of interest, with contrast enhancement and consecutive frame differences. ",True
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ","The paper does not explicitly mention the use of any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the deep learning pipeline uses large amounts of labeled data produced by analysts using the UI. This data is used to classify dozens of species signals and event types across ongoing projects. The paper also mentions the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward neural networks (DNNs) to audio spectrogram and image data. This suggests that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are likely audio and image data related to biodiversity monitoring. ",True
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation of the data. Normalization and scaling help to bring the data to a similar scale, cleaning helps to remove any noise or irrelevant data, and augmentation helps to increase the size of the dataset. ",True
