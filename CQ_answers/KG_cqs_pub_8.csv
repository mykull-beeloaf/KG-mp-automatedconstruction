2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data for detecting plant organs on herbarium scans. The plant organs are detected using an object detection network, which works by localising each object with a bounding box on the image and classifying it. The network used in this study is called Faster R-CNN, which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and is used for image data. Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. ",True
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ","The deep learning pipeline in this study uses the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning. The initial layers of the CNN are initialized with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset, and the deeper layers are fine-tuned using the annotated herbarium scan dataset. ",True
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are often involved. These can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique used to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is a method used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting erroneous data from a dataset. However, the specific preprocessing steps can vary depending on the dataset and the model being used. In this study, the herbarium scans were rescaled from their original average size of ca. 5100 by 3500 pixels to 1200 by 800 pixels, in order to preserve the aspect ratio of the scans and to speed up the learning by reducing the number of pixels. ",True

12,"What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?","The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the Faster R-CNN model is used, which is based on the ResNet-50 architecture. ",True
15,"What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?",The model was implemented with the Detectron2 library in PyTorch framework and trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0. 0025 and momentum of 0. 9.,True
13,"What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?","The deep learning model was implemented with the Detectron2 library in PyTorch framework and trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimiser with a learning rate of 0. 0025 and momentum of 0. 9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network had six anchor scales [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024] (square root of area in absolute pixels) each with three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1]. The thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) were 0. 6 for training and 0. 25 for testing, respectively. ",True
22,"What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?","The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the COCO evaluation metric, which determines whether the predicted organs and their locations are correct. The minimum threshold chosen for any prediction to be acceptable is having a confidence score (probability) of 0. 5. The COCO method calculates average precision (with values from 0 to 100), which is a metric that encapsulates both precision and recall of the detection, for the entire predictions and each class of organs at different levels of Intersection over Union (IoU). IoU is an evaluation metric that quantifies the overlap of the predicted bounding boxes with the ground-truth bounding boxes. The IoU score ranges from 0 to 1, the higher the overlap, the higher the IoU score. The evaluation method considers all predictions as positive that have IoU of at least 0. 5 and the average precision at this level of IoU is called AP50. Similarly, the average precision with a minimum IoU of 0. 75 is called AP75, whereas AP is the average over 10 IoU levels from 0. 5 to 0. 95 with a step size of 0. 05. The precision metrics evaluated on the predicted organs on the test subset are shown in Table 2. The COCO method also calculates the AP for each category, as shown in Table 3, along with the total bounding boxes for each category in the test subset. ",True
