2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The deep learning pipeline in this context uses image data. The activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet are employed as feature representations. The weights of this deep network are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. ",True
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ","The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are ImageNet and Benthoz15. ImageNet is used for pre-training the VGGnet, while Benthoz15 is used for fine-tuning the network. ",True
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","The context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, while scaling adjusts the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. ",False
