Named Entities:
DeepLearningPipeline(segmentation of bird vocalizations from audio spectrograms)
DataFormat(audio spectrogram figures)
DataAugmentationTechnique(small random rotations between -5 and 5 degrees as well as random displacements at the maximum of the 10% of the image)
Dataset(spectrogram figures of bird recordings as well as recordings void of any bird activity and their corresponding binary masks)
PreprocessingStep(training, the spectrogram is presented as input, and the mask is presented as output, learns the mapping in-between them)
